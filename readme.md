# Ricky Haase - Personal Portfolio - September 2021

Just a little something that I whipped up to both polish up my vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS and exercise my design skills.

All testing was done with a trackpad and with that the CSS snap-scroll functionality worked super seamlessly. With a scrollwheel on a mouse, not so much. I will need to impliment something like [fullPage](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) inorder to get the full effect I was going for.

Custom scrollbars on windows would also go a long way to tidying up the cohesion of the design across platforms.
