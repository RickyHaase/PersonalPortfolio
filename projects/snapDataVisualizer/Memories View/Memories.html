         <h3>Snapchat Memories</h3>
         <p>Snapchat has a cloud photo storage feature called Memories.</p>
         <!-- None of the links in the sample datasets will work inorder to protect the privacy of the user's who's data sets they are -->
         <p>The links are the links included in the data files but they will not work for viewing/downloading files until intigration with the API is complete.</p>
         <!-- Need to improve his script to include meta-data for the content including atleast the original time the photo was taken but ideally the location data aswell -->
         <p>I intended on having 1-click downloading for all Memories but ran out of time to figure out how to integrate <a href="https://github.com/ToTheMax/Snapchat-All-Memories-Downloader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: white;">this</a> script into the system. Feel free to use his script to download all of your memories at once.</p>
